          <h2>What a result is</h2>
          <p>One model at one quantization, on one runtime, on either your whole rig or one part inside it. The headline number is decode speed in tokens per second. Prompt-processing speed and time to first token are welcome but optional.</p>
          <h2>How to measure decode tok/s</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Generate at least 256 tokens from a short prompt and average over a few runs.</li>
            <li>Report the runtime version you used and link the repo you ran in, yours or the runtime's.</li>
            <li>Note the flags and settings that moved the number: the backend you compiled in, flash attention, KV cache precision. The same card on the same runtime can differ twofold on these.</li>
            <li>If you ran on one card out of several, submit it as a component result and set the quantity you used.</li>
            <li>A Core Ultra chip carries CPU cores, an iGPU, and an NPU, and each is its own part. Submit the unit the model ran on; a result on the CPU part means its cores. Use whole rig when the run spanned more than one unit.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Ranking</h2>
          <p>Each rig, or each part at a given quantity, appears once on a board at its best decode tok/s. The earliest run wins a tie. Boards mix runtimes; filter by runtime to compare like with like.</p>
          <h2>Stock and modified runtimes</h2>
          <p>A result says whether it ran on a stock runtime — the released one, however you configured or built it — or a modified one, where you changed the runtime itself with a custom kernel or op, a patch, or a fork. A modified stack can beat stock by a wide margin on the same silicon, so boards rank stock runs against each other and leave modified ones out until you turn on <strong>Include modified</strong>. Nothing is hidden and modified results are not lesser; they answer a different question, and they rank among each other on the same board. A modified result carries the fork and the exact revision behind it, because an implementation changes week to week and only the revision makes the number reproducible.</p>
          <h2>Verification</h2>
          <p>Every result starts self-reported. When enough signed-in members confirm it, it becomes community-verified. Confirm only what you reproduced or checked.</p>
          <h2>Flags</h2>
          <p>Flag numbers that look implausible, wrong hardware, duplicates, or spam. Past a few flags an entry is hidden until the team reviews it.</p>
          <h2 id="by-pr">Submitting by pull request</h2>
          <p>Prefer git? Add a JSON file under <code>results/your-handle/</code> in <a href={REPO_URL} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">{REPO}</a> and open a pull request. A check validates it against the catalog and comments with a link that opens the submit form filled in from your file, with the pull request as the evidence link. The format is in the repo's <a href={`${REPO_URL}/tree/main/results`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">results folder</a>. Going the other way, every freshly submitted result offers "Add to the results repo", which writes the file for you.</p>
          <h2>Adding hardware or models</h2>
          <p>The catalog of hardware, models, runtimes, and quantizations lives in the same repo, in <a href={CATALOG_DIR_URL} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">frontend/src/catalog</a>. Add the part or model there, open a pull request, and it appears on the site with the next deploy. The folder's README shows the shape of each entry.</p>

          <p>{BRAND_NAME} tracks how fast local models run on Intel silicon: Core Ultra chips with the iGPU and NPU on their package, Arc and Arc Pro cards, Xeon, and Gaudi. People sign in with GitHub, register the machines they run models on, and post the tokens per second they get for a model at a given quantization on a given runtime.</p>
          <p>Rigs decompose into parts, so a result can describe the whole machine or one unit inside it: a single card, the CPU cores, the iGPU, or the NPU. The same chip can hold three numbers, and the boards keep them apart.</p>
          <p>Results are self-reported and checked by the community. Nothing here is a lab benchmark, and that is the point: it is what people actually see on hardware they actually own.</p>
          <p>The hardware database is open source and grows by pull request. Intel parts are seeded and lead the boards; parts from other vendors are welcome alongside them, so the comparisons stay honest.</p>
